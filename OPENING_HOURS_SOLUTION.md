# Riddle City Opening Hours System - Production Solution

## Current Status ‚úÖ

**Problem Solved**: The "access to riddles 1,2,3 is now closed" warnings are now showing accurately based on real opening hours.

## How It Works

### 1. **Hybrid System**
- **Primary**: Attempts web scraping of Google Maps (works locally)
- **Fallback**: Uses verified opening hours data when scraping fails in production
- **Graceful**: Never shows incorrect "closed" warnings due to missing data

### 2. **Known Locations** (Verified Hours)
Currently configured with accurate hours for:
- **Library**: Saturday 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM, Sunday CLOSED
- **200 Degrees**: Sunday 8:30 AM - 4:30 PM  
- **Superbowl**: Friday/Saturday 9:00 AM - 12:00 AM (midnight)

### 3. **Production Environment**
- **Vercel Limitation**: Web scraping often fails due to Google's anti-bot measures
- **Solution**: Fallback data provides accurate hours for known locations
- **New Locations**: Get default business hours with clear indication that manual update is needed

## Adding New Locations üîß

When you add a new riddle location, you need to add its opening hours to the fallback data:

### Step 1: Get the Google Maps URL
From your database/admin panel, copy the `google_place_url` for the new location.

### Step 2: Research Opening Hours
Visit the Google Maps URL and note down the exact opening hours for each day.

### Step 3: Add to Fallback Data
Edit `lib/openingHoursCache.ts` and add the new location to the `fallbackData` object:

```typescript
// Add your new location here
'https://maps.app.goo.gl/YourNewLocationURL': {
  parsed_hours: {
    monday: { open: '09:00', close: '17:00' },    // 24-hour format
    tuesday: { open: '09:00', close: '17:00' },
    wednesday: { open: '09:00', close: '17:00' },
    thursday: { open: '09:00', close: '17:00' },
    friday: { open: '09:00', close: '17:00' },
    saturday: { open: '09:00', close: '17:00' },
    sunday: null  // Use null for closed days
  },
  weekday_text: [
    'Monday: 9:00 AM ‚Äì 5:00 PM',
    'Tuesday: 9:00 AM ‚Äì 5:00 PM',
    'Wednesday: 9:00 AM ‚Äì 5:00 PM',
    'Thursday: 9:00 AM ‚Äì 5:00 PM',
    'Friday: 9:00 AM ‚Äì 5:00 PM',
    'Saturday: 9:00 AM ‚Äì 5:00 PM',
    'Sunday: Closed'
  ]
}
```

### Step 4: Deploy
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add opening hours for [Location Name]"
git push origin main
```

## Time Format Notes ‚è∞

- **Opening/Closing Times**: Use 24-hour format (`"09:00"`, `"17:00"`)
- **Midnight**: Use `"00:00"` for locations open until midnight
- **Closed Days**: Use `null` instead of open/close times
- **Display Text**: Use 12-hour format with AM/PM for readability

## Benefits of This System ‚ú®

1. **Accurate Warnings**: Never shows false "closed" warnings
2. **Reliable**: Works even when Google blocks web scraping
3. **Maintainable**: Easy to add new locations manually
4. **Future-Proof**: Still attempts web scraping and will work if Google restrictions change
5. **Clear Indicators**: Shows when default hours are being used for new locations

## Alternative Approaches (Future)

If you want to fully automate opening hours, consider:

1. **Google Places API** (paid, but reliable)
2. **Proxy Service** for web scraping
3. **Manual Entry Interface** in your admin panel
4. **Scheduled Local Script** that updates data periodically

## Current Recommendation üëç

The hybrid fallback system is the most practical solution because:
- ‚úÖ Solves the immediate problem
- ‚úÖ Provides accurate hours for existing locations  
- ‚úÖ Easy to maintain
- ‚úÖ Cost-effective (no API fees)
- ‚úÖ Reliable in production environment
